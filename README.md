---

## How To Approach This Tutorial

* This tutorial is still in progress and will be up shortly.

## What We're Building

* This tutorial is an expansion of my first "Just Another React Tutorial" 
	* You can find the introduction here [https://github.com/Jingo88/Just_Another_React_Tutorial](https://github.com/Jingo88/Just_Another_React_Tutorial)
* We will be taking the code from the previous movie app we made, and refactoring many of the containers and components
* We will be adding new containers and components
* We will be created a router that will have these containers and components nested
* The user will search for a movie by a title
* All movies that relate to that title will be returned in JSON format
* The list of movies will be rendered on the page using React
* If a user clicks on a specific movie they will be shown the details of that movie
